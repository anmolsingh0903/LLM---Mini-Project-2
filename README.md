# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Word2Vec & GloVe
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment classification using Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings.
The goal is to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
It demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline — text preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.

## **🚀 Features**

### **Data Preprocessing:**

- Cleaning reviews, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

### **Text Vectorization:**

- Word2Vec embeddings (Gensim)

- Pre-trained GloVe embeddings

### **Machine Learning Models:**

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Naive Bayes

### **Model Evaluation:**

- Accuracy Score

- Confusion Matrix

- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Programming Language: Python 3

### **Libraries & Tools:**

- Gensim → Word2Vec implementation

- NLTK / SpaCy → Text preprocessing

- Scikit-learn → Model building, vectorization & evaluation metrics
